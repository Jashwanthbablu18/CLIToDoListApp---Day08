# 📝 Day 8 - To-Do List App

Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to **Day 8** of my **#30DaysOfPythonChallenge**. Today, I built a simple CLI-based **To-Do List App** to practice and demonstrate how Python lists work in real-world scenarios.

---

## 📌 What’s This About?
Today’s focus: **Python Lists** — learning how to store, manage, and manipulate collections of data using list operations.

---

## 💭 Why Build This?
Lists are foundational in Python. This app:
- Encourages hands-on list manipulation
- Teaches how to use methods like `.append()` and `.pop()`
- Shows how to display lists cleanly and interactively

---

## ✨ Features

Here’s what the app can do:
- ➕ Add new tasks to your to-do list
- ✏️ Update existing tasks
- ❌ Remove tasks or use `.pop()` to complete the last one
- 👀 View a preview of tasks using slicing (`[:3]`, `[-2:]`)
- 🔢 Display tasks with numbering using `enumerate()`

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stuff

Built with:
- 🐍 **Python 3**
- 📋 List operations: `.append()`, `.pop()`, slicing, indexing
- 🔁 `for` loop with `enumerate()` for clean task display
- 🧼 Input validation for a smoother experience

---

## 🚀 Getting It Running

### ✅ What You’ll Need
Just Python 3!  
Run the code using:
```bash
python Day-08Code.py
